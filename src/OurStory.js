					<p>From a Bio-scientist to a new Mom to a scientist-chef, it has been quite a journey. It wasnâ€™t until my daughter was four years old that I discovered I had a passion for teaching science to kids as much as I had a passion for hard-core science. And it all started at the dinner table...</p>
					<p>Every evening at dinnertime, my daughter would ask me questions about the food in front of her. And every evening, I would demonstrate a lesson in science or math in explanation to her question. Innovative STEM teaching became my part-time job besides being a full-time scientist at UC Berkeley. Trying to explain to my five year old: how bread puffs up, why pasta when cooked turns soft and egg when cooked turns hard, what gives lemons their sour (hint: acidic) taste, or her favorite, when will jell-o set while exploring the answers hands-on and then eating the result has been unexplainably rewarding.</p>
					<p>I am putting together these tried, tested and tasted  experimental experiences in bite sized (pun intended) culinary programs for kids to enjoy!</p>
