				<p>From a Bio-scientist to a new Mom to a scientist-chef. It has been quite a journey – it wasn’t until my daughter was four years old that I discovered I had a passion for teaching science to kids as much as I had a passion for hard-core science. And it all started at the dinner table...</p>
				<p>Every evening at dinnertime Nyneisha would ask me questions about the food in front of her. And every evening I ended up demonstrating a lesson in science or math or both in explanation to her question. Innovative STEM teaching became my part-time job besides being a full-time scientist at UC Berkeley. Those who were privy to this demonstration constantly asked me 
				</p>
				<p>"Why don't you teach college students at an University as a Professor?" My answer: Because it is far more challenging to explain “the central dogma” or “quantum mechanics” or “metabolomics” or “calculus” to a 5 year old at the dinner table.............And I'm up to that challenge.</p>
				<p>I’m kidding about the topics but not about science at the dinner table. Trying to explain to my five year old: How bread puffs up OR Why pasta when cooked turns soft and egg when cooked turns hard OR What gives lemons their sour (hint: acidic) taste OR her favorite When will jell-o set; while exploring the answers hands-on and then eating the result has been unexplainably rewarding.</p>
				<p>I am putting together these tried, tested and tasted "yummilicious" experimental experiences in bite sized (pun intended) culinary programs for kids ages 5-10 to Enjoy!</p>
