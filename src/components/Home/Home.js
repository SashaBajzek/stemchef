						<h1>Scientific Cooking for Kids</h1>
						<p>StemChef was founded with the vision to inspire little ones to love and appreciate science and math through "experimental" cooking. We turn everyday cooking and eating into curiosity-filled culinary experiments, where every class is complete with a new recipe, a new scientific principle and a new mathematical concept.</p>

							<h2>HOW?</h2>
							<p>Think about simple everyday kitchen happenings:</p>
							<p>Cooking an egg, Baking a cupcake, Making an ice-pop</p>
							<p>The working principles behind these rather common activities will be explored and understood by your very own little chefs. They will be solving yummy challenges mathematically while whipping up delicious edible experiments.</p>
