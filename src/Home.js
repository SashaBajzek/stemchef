							<p>StemChef was founded with the vision to inspire little ones to love and appreciate science and math through "experimental" cooking. We turn everyday cooking and eating into curiosity-filled culinary experiments, where every class is complete with a new recipe, a new scientific principle and a new mathematical concept.</p>

						<h2>WHAT?</h2>
						<p>A new approach to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning for kids through food and cooking.</p>
					</section>
					<section className="Home__section">
						<h2>WHO?</h2>
						<p>Curiosity and learning knows no age boundaries. However, our program is designed for kids ages 5 â€“ 10 and teens ages 11-15. Classes are divided to accommodate for the age and skill level of each child.</p>
					</section>
					<section className="Home__section">
						<h2>WHY?</h2>
						<p>Textbook learning gets mundane, especially for young children.</p>
						<p>StemChef makes science and math both fun and relatable as children learn through following yummy recipes and getting messy.</p>
					</section>
					<section className="Home__section">
						<h2>HOW?</h2>
						<p>Think about simple everyday kitchen happenings:</p>
						<p>Cooking an egg, Baking a cupcake, Making an ice-pop</p>
						<p>The working principles behind these rather common activities will be explored and understood by your very own little chefs as they solve yummy challenges mathematically while whipping up delicious edible experiments.</p>
